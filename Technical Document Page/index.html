    <li>Abstract</li>
    <p> The constant climate change could be devastating to vulnerable coastal forests in
a densely populated country like Bangladesh. Moreover, it's affecting the function
and structure of coastal areas and their rich natural resources. The vast collection
of RS datasets available with GEE (e.g., archived Landsat and Sentinel images) will
be helpful to address global challenges such as climate change. Remote sensing
(RS) and QGIS applications can monitor the earth's surface and atmosphere on
different scales such as global, regional, and local. Collecting images over
additional years can detect the risk to reduce risk on coastal regions, and It can
also analyze the coastal environment changes..</p>
    <p> Using the Semi-Automatic
Classification Plugin for QGIS, two Landsat images acquired over the study area
have been classified. QGIS has facilitated processing big geo-data over large areas
and monitoring the environment for long periods. Analyzing Landsat satellite
imagery and aerial imagery, specific classification over large regions, and
monitoring landscape over several decades can determine the change in the
coastal areas</p>

    <li>Introduction</li>
    <p>According to an agreement of COP21, Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our
time, and it has been a most talked about the issue by different countries and communities the
world over. The effects of climate change are already hitting the most vulnerable countries.
Bangladesh has frequently faced extreme climatic events, such as erratic rainfall, flooding,
drought, sea-level rise, cyclones, and salinity intrusion. Since the country is already evidencing
the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change, there are different ways that it
affects coastal areas. For example, climate shocks and stresses in Bangladesh are already
damaging assets, undermining livelihoods, and displacing people from their homes.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh, eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population of over 163 million
with an area of 56,980 sq mi. Moreover, 29% of the population lives in coastal areas. Coastal
areas in Bangladesh are on the front line of Climate Change. Due to climatic change, our
country is vulnerable to storm surges, drainage congestion, and sea-level rise. The vast area of
Bangladesh is less than ten meters above sea level, and for the other parts, almost ten percent
of the country is below 1 meter, making it highly vulnerable to increasing high tides. Coastal
areas are sensitive to sea-level rise, changes in the intensity of natural storms, precipitation
increasing, and ocean temperatures getting down. The rising acidity of carbon dioxide (CO2)
can significantly impact coastal and marine ecosystems.</p> 
    <p>The consequences are likely to worsen problems that coastal areas already face. Confronting
existing challenges that affect artificial infrastructure development and coastline, such as
shoreline falling, increased flooding, and dense pollution in water is already a concern in many
rural areas. There is a need for new ways to cope with this issue so that the life of the coastal
regions becomes easier.</p>
    <p>Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System provide practical tools such as QGIS, a
geographic information system application that is used in viewing different geospatial data and
analyzing them for monitoring different parts of the world, which is contributing to an
ecosystem and socio-economic management.</li></p>
    <p>This study used geospatial technology (QGIS, RS) to signify the importance of land cover
changes over the coastal areas of Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Jhalokati, which possibly
helped assess the area's change dynamics. Scientific change assessment may also help the
government understand the current state of the area and the relationship between
physiographic and manufactured features. The main objective is to evaluate the nature,
significance, and rate of land area change from 2011-2021. Our main goal is to present a
scientific result by monitoring rapid change and magnitude of change around the study area.
With the introduction of Remote Sensing and GIS application, monitoring different parts of the8 | P a g e
world has become easier and gaining popularity over the recent years. Therefore, a new idea of
generating a digitize cover map so that the people can monitor the changes in the land cover
using Satellite is going to be very useful for the people as well as the government.</p>

    <li>Study Area</li>
    <p>
Our study area is the coastal areas of Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Jhalokati is located of
Bangladesh, between the final coordinates of (22°N, 89°E), (22°N, 90°E), (22° N, 90° E), (21° N,
90°E), (21° N, 89°E). The total area of our study area is calculated using the classification map
including all Geographic features and land cover.</li></p>
    <p><li>Data Collection</li>
      First of all, we need a smooth data set with less cloud in the atmosphere. So, we collected our
data set from USGS EarthExplorer. The USGS Earth Explorer is a similar tool to the USGS Global
Visualization Viewer (GloVis) in that user search catalogs of satellite and aerial imagery.
However, the USGS Earth Explorer is the new and improved version. In addition, the USGS Earth
Explorer gives some extra capabilities: Downloading data over chronological timelines.13 | P a g e
We downloaded Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor)
Level-1 under Landsat Collection 1 Level 1 from earth explorer.
We reduced our dataset, and the final coordinates are (22°N, 89°E), (22°N, 90°E), (22° N, 90° E),
(21° N, 90°E), (21° N, 89°E).
The generated and digitized cover maps of the coastal area are (Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali,
and Jhalokati) of Bangladesh, which we will be using in the GIS application.</p> 

<li>Data Analysis</li>
<p>The comprehensive analysis is based on transforming ideas into maps and graphs. The raw
Landsat-8 satellite images contain a cell value called Digital Number. The digital numbers for
each image cell are first converted into reflectance values. After pre-processing, the study area
(Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Jhalokati ) had been masked from the whole image. By
doing this, the image size got reduced, which made the work more flexible and precise. After
pre-processing, data classification were done to classify the map. All these necessary steps
were done for this change detection analysis using the QGIS software tool. The integration of
several methods identified the critical change areas.</p>

    <li> Data Classification</li>
    <p>It is helpful in performing classification previews to assess the classification quality (for
example, a common problem is a soil classified as built-up and vice versa). However, if the
preview result is not good, we need to go back to the phase of ROI creation, delete the faulty
ROIs, and create new ones.
The remotely-sensed image classification can be performed through several algorithms; we will
use the Maximum Likelihood classification in this study.
Maximum likelihood classification assumes that the statistics for each class in each band are
typically distributed and calculates the probability that a given pixel belongs to a specific class.
Unless you select a probability threshold, all pixels are classified. Then, each pixel is assigned to
the class with the highest probability (the maximum likelihood). If the highest chance is smaller
than the threshold we specify, the pixel remains unclassified.</p>

    <li>Data Post Processing </li>
    <p>This section aims to analyze land cover change using the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin
(SCP) Postprocessing tools. We will assess land cover change from two raster classifications and
relate the changes to a land-use vector file.
Here, we will take the raster classified file of our regions, as we are working on the last decade
(2011 to 2021 season), so we divided the decade into two parts (2011 to 2016 season) and
(2017 to 2021 season). We will apply LULC classification between these two-raster
classifications.
For change detection using LULC Classification, we must maintain two things, Firstly the classes
of two raster classifications must be the same. In our work, we classified our map into 4 Macro
Classes.
i)waterbody, ii) agricultural land, iii) forest area, iv) surface.
But, on the other hand, the sequence must need to be identical for both raster classifications.
We need to choose our reference classification and the new classification for further
movement.
Reference classification is the previous SCP classification, and the new classification means the
current SCP classification. Therefore, we choose the 2011 to 2016 raster image as reference
classification for our work and 2017 to 2021 raster image as a new classification.</p>

     <li>Discussion</li>
<p>There are two broad methods of Change Detection Techniques includes- a) Pre-Classification
Method b) Post Classification Method. Pre-Classification method analyzes the change without
classifying the image. Post classification calculates the change in land cover based on a detailed
categorized classification of land cover. Post Classification comparison, Aerial Difference
calculation etc., are some common post-classification Change detection approaches.
a) Pre-Classification Method
For our project, we collected the maps from 2011-2021. We divided the maps into two parts
(2011-2016) and (2017 to 2021).
For the first part (2011-2016), We measured the changes in four categories: i) waterbody, ii)
agricultural land, iii) forest area, iv) surface. We determined the coordinate where I) Upper
Left: (177176.963,2494692.08) and II) Lower Right: (281567.879,2411730.38). From the
classification, we found the following map (fig. 7). From this classification report, we used the
given training input to calculate the value of the areas. The values are:
i) waterbody is 2388167.1 sq km
ii) agricultural land is 2635664.4 sq km
iii) forest area is 1174818.6 sq km
iv) surface area is 1973582.1 sq km </li></p>

<p>For the second part (2017-2021), We measured the changes in four categories: i) waterbody, ii)
agricultural land, iii) forest area, iv) surface. We determined the coordinate where I) Upper
Left: (177176.963,2494692.08) and II) Lower Right: (281567.879,2411730.38). From the
classification, we found the following map (fig. 7). From this classification report, we used the
given training input to calculate the value of the areas. The values are:
i)waterbody is2418135.3 sq km
ii) agricultural land is 2331975.6 sq km
iii) forest area is 434786.9 sq km
iv) surface area is 2592711.9 sq km
</p>
<li>Conclusion</li>
    <p>The coastal areas in Bangladesh are essential for economic development due to their rich
natural resources. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for a monitoring application to create
awareness among people living in the coastal areas. Remote sensing (RS) and GIS applications
are powerful tools for monitoring the changes in the large areas of coastal regions by providing
critical mapping and classification of the coverage map.
For detecting changes in our study area, temporal Landsat-8 images of 2011-2021 have been
used. We measured the changes in four categories: water body, agricultural land, forest area,
surface area where progressive changes are found for agricultural land, forest area and surface.
This study will support identifying the temporal changes. According to that, the intended
authority will be able to take appropriate steps for the safety and progress of the people living
in the coastal areas. We could still avoid the worst climate impacts by taking necessary steps,
and urgent action is needed to build resilience through economic development to reduce the
risks in our coastal regions. Our country, Bangladesh, would need to prepare for a long-term
adaptation strategy. It is necessary to identify all present vulnerabilities and future
opportunities, adjusting priorities for people living in the coastal areas while promoting training
and education throughout the population in all possible spheres.</p>
